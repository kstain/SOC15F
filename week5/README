Description of the online mall project:

There is a wsdl file in the project which includes three services: paymentService, PurchaseOrderService and ShippingService, 
corresponding to three port types: paymentPT, purchaseOrderPT and shippingPT. They provide the service for customers' payment
submission, purchase order submission and shipping schedule request. The business process uses three partner links to connect 
these services: purchasing, payment and shipping. 
The business process is in a sequence, first a purchase order from the customer is received, then the paymentService is invoked
to submit the payment and then invoke the shipping service. Finally, a completed result is replied to the customer.
